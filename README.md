# PixelPalette
This is a PoC for creating sprites out of a string with digits ranging from 0 to 3, with each digit representing a color of the color palette.  
If you want to try it out, just enter any of these numbers in the 'Draw here' Panel.

I really didn't care that much about mobile friendliness or design or anything.  
It's just a PoC as mentioned above.

This project uses webpack for building.

`yarn build` - Build the Project  
`yarn serve` - Start dev server  
`yarn deploy` - You can provide your own firebase data to deploy to firebase hosting
